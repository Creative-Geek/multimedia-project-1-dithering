# Multimedia Assignment

This is an assignment I created for a college class using html/css/js.

## Objective

The objective of this project was to implement various image processing techniques using Python. However, I decided to implement them in JavaScript because I'm a bit of a maniac; do not judge. (Yes, I know Python would have been easier, but where's the fun in that?)

## Overview

This is a web app that consists of three sections:

- **Image Dithering**
  - Error Diffusion Dithering
  - Ordered Dithering
  - Pattern Dithering
- **Image Transitions**
  - Cross Dissolve Transition
  - Dither Dissolve Transition
- **Compression**
  - Text Compression using Run-Length Encoding
